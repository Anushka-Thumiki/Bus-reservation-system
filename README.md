# Bus-reservation-system

The idea of this project has stemmed from the need for simple travel solutions. Buses are the most commonly used forms of travel in India, be it within a city or intra-city. In fact, buses are sometimes the only form of transportation available to reach the remote parts of India. This bus reservation system is a user-friendly, menu driven program,
which is designed to book the tickets for a bus by providing the customers with the best bus transportation services from the comforts of their homes and offices. It is an interactive and interesting program which guides the user throughout with popup texts hence making it close to real life booking system. It is done with the help of Python-SQL connectivity. Tables are created at the back end in SQL and the front end consists of functions in Python. 

The introduction pdf contains a brief summary of what the program does.
When the program is executed, the person operating is first asked if he is an admin or a user. If admin is entered, he has to login. Only if he enters a correct username and password, the admin menu is shown. If user is entered, ‘Welcome to Slide Travels’ appears on the screen and the menu is directly displayed. The user details are stored and read from text file, while the admin usernames and passwords are stored and read from csv file.

The source code pdf contains the entire working code of the program.
The screenshots pdf contains the output of the program when executed.

• Text files and CSV files
• User-defined functions
• Built-in functions
• Loops (for, nested for, while)
• If-else and elif statements
• Jump statements (break, continue and pass)
• Python-Sql connectivity
• Other libraries and modules (csv and mysql.connector)
